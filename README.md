# MergePdfs

Simple PDF application I put together for myself because of restrictions imposed by online mergers.
To use, download [Plus.exe](https://github.com/Nnadozie/MergePdfs/blob/master/Plus.exe)

Usage: each time a pdf is selected it's compressed and merged to an output file called MergedPdf in the same directory as Plus.exe. Rename output file once done.
